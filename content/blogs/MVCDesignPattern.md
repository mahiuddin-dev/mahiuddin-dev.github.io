## What is MVC?

By separating concerns and providing a clear structure, it enables developers to create scalable and flexible codebases. Whether you're building a web application, a desktop software, or a game, understanding and implementing MVC can significantly improve the quality of your project. Embrace MVC, and unlock the potential for building software that stands the test of time.
