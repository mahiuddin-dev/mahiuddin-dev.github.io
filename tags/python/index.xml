It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea is to determine, in logarithmic time, whether the item you are searching for is in the lower or upper half of the interval. If it is in the lower half, you repeat the process on that half; if it is in the upper half, you repeat the process on that half. This process continues until the item is found or the search interval is empty.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction to Python Programming</title><link>https://mahiuddin.me/blogs/introduction-to-python-programming/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 21:04:50 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mahiuddin.me/blogs/introduction-to-python-programming/</guid><description>&lt;p>Python is a popular, high-level programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.
